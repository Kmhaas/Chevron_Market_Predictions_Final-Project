# Safe_Market_Predictions_Final-Project
## Topic 
 Chevron Corporation is an American multinational energy corporation. One of the successor companies of Standard Oil. I want to create a machine learning model to predict their closing prices for the next 30 days to see if Chevrons closing price will go up or down.
## Why 
Can Chevron continue to be a safe and wise investment for investors?  
## Source of data
Yahoo Finance as a pip install yfinance in my anaconda prompt.
## Questions I hope to answer
* Is chevron a safe invest?
* Why or why not?
* Other energy companies also a safe investment?
