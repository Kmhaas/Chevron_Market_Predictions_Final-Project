# Safe_Market_Predictions_Final-Project
## Topic 
 Chevron Corporation is an American multinational energy corporation. One of the successor companies of Standard Oil. Recently with the inflation rates here in america Chevron has really become a winner for investors who invested in the recent years seeing a large spike in Chevron's stock prices. I want to create a machine learning model to predict their closing prices to see if this growth is sustainable or is going to crash. 
## Why 
Can Chevron continue to be a safe and wise investment for investors or with the politics of todays White House going from gas to eletric vehichels and the ending of fossil fuel usage? 
## Source of data
Yahoo Finance as a pip install yfinance in my anaconda prompt. Yfinace builds datasets from their data right into the jupyter notebook no import pandas necessary. 
## Questions I hope to answer
* Is chevron a safe invest?
* Why or why not?
* Other energy companies also a safe investment?
