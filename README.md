# Safe_Market_Predictions_Final-Project
## Topic 
Johnson & Johnson, Chevron, Target, Lowes, Gilead Sciences are 5 stocks with dividends. I want to create a machine learning model to predict whether or not an investor can make a ROI of 10 % with each one of the dividend stocks.
## Why 
Can you make a ROI of 10% in the stock market only investing in dividend stocks ? 
## Source of data
Yahoo Finance as a pip install yfinance in my anaconda prompt. Selected list of 5 Stocks with dividends with history of dividends selected from yfinance to create a dataset for the machine learning model. Stock tickers: JNJ, CVX, TGT, LOW, GILD
## Questions I hope to answer
* With the volatility of the market can you bet on getting a ROI of 10% with dividend stocks? 
* Why did the dividend stocks not prove to be profitable?
