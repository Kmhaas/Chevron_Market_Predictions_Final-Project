# Safe_Market_Predictions_Final-Project
## Topic 
Johnson & Johnson, Chevron, Target, Lowes, Gilead Sciences are 5 stocks with dividends. I want to create a machine learning model to predict their closing prices.
## Why 
Can you make a safe investment in the stock market only with investing in dividend stocks ? 
## Source of data
Yahoo Finance as a pip install yfinance in my anaconda prompt. Selected list of 5 Stocks with dividends selected from yfinance to create a dataset for the machine learning model. Stock tickers: JNJ, CVX, TGT, LOW, GILD
## Questions I hope to answer
* With the volatility of the market can you bet on dividend stocks? 
* Why did the dividend stocks not prove to be profitable?
